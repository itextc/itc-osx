# Islāmic Text Copier
This is a simple text copying program. The goal of this app is simple; give the user easy access to commonly used Arabic texts on their PC, such as Subḥānahu wa Taʾālá and Sallá Allāhu ʿAlayhī wa as-Salam.

The release can be downloaded at it's official home page: https://itc.nasiratif.net.

# Contributions
I decided to open-source this program so that anyone can contribute to it, like fixing bugs and adding more texts. It is programmed entirely in Python, so make sure you have knowledge of it and have it installed on your PC.

To setup ITC, you'll need to have a few Python modules already installed, like Pyperclip, Keyboard, ctypes, Pillow and pyglet.

You can build ITC in many different ways, though I prefer Auto PY to EXE. The Inno Setup source is also included (you will need to change the directories inside however).

بارك الله فيك
